# Escape
For my undergraduate coding class. Reading in a file of room descriptions, the player can look and navigate through rooms to find the exit.

__How To Play:__
- Compile escape.cpp
- Make sure the room file is in the same folder as the program
- Type "./escape room_file" into the command prompt (ex. "./escape room1")
- It's ready to go once you see the ">" asking for input

__Controls:__
- n = North
- s = South
- e = East
- w = West
- q = Quit
